# Veriket Applications

This repository contains two main projects: `VeriketApplicationTest` (Windows Service) and `WinFormApplication` (Windows Forms Application), along with a Setup Project for installation and configuration.

## VeriketApplicationTest (Windows Service)

The `VeriketApplicationTest` is a Windows Service that performs logging activities. It is designed to run in the background, starting automatically upon system startup and logging information such as date, computer name, and user name.

### Features

- Automatic service start after installation.
- Continuous logging with a specified interval defined in the app configuration.
- Error logging in case of failures.

### Installation

The service is installed using the provided Setup Project, which registers the service and sets it to start automatically.

### Usage

Once installed, the service will start automatically and begin logging data to the configured log file. The log file path is specified in the `app.config` file.

## WinFormApplication (Windows Forms Application)

The `WinFormApplication` is a GUI-based application that reads and displays log data generated by the `VeriketApplicationTest` service.

### Features

- Display log data in a user-friendly DataGridView.
- Load and refresh log data with a button click.
- Error handling for missing or inaccessible log files.

### Usage

Run the application, and use the "Load" button to fetch and display log data from the log file.

## Setup Project

The Setup Project is configured to install both `VeriketApplicationTest` and `WinFormApplication` simultaneously. It also handles the service start-up upon installation completion and removes the service and related files upon uninstallation.

### Installation Process

1. Download the `VeriketAppSetup.msi` installer from the [Setup File](Setup%20File/VeriketAppSetup.msi) link in the main directory of this repository.
2. Execute the downloaded `.msi` installer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install both applications.
4. Upon completion, the service will start automatically, and the Windows Forms application will be available for use.

### Uninstallation Process

1. Use the Windows "Add or Remove Programs" feature.
2. Select the installed application suite to uninstall.
3. The uninstaller will automatically stop the service and remove all related files.
